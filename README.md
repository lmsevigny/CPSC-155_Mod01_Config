# Module 01 
# Exercise: Checking Git Configurations and Settings

## Step 1
Run the `./chaos_monkey.sh` script.

**NOTE**: you will have to give this script execute permissions before it will run

## Step 2
Use the `git config` command to get the value of the `chaos.monkey` property stored in the **local** git repository.

**NOTE**: this property is stored only in this cloned repository, and it is not stored in the global git settings.
